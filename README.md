## Work experience so far

### [Robotica, Norwich](https://robotica.media)

**Junior Software Developer, Summer Placement, August 2022**

Robotica is an ML tech startup developing a fully automated solution for translating speech from 20 languages into signed languages using a realistic human avatar. My goal was to gather and prepare MP3 audio and transcript data from the open source ebook Project Gutenberg, to help improve their lip-sync service.

I wrote Python code to crawl the online project, create a SQLite database, query it, download the MP3 audio files and transcript files for each book, convert the MP3s to WAVs, and place them in individual folders. I then created a text chunker, which split sentences up on punctuation, placing the index of the first and last character along with the sentence into a complex data structure.

From here, Robotica were able to feed the data into a Montreal Forced Aligner to line up the speech with the text to help improve the lip-sync service.

### [Allies Computing, Norwich](https://www.alliescomputing.com)

**Junior Software Developer, Summer Placement, August 2021**

> News article: [Allies work experience student plugs Postcoder into Alexa](https://alliescomputing.com/news/student-plugs-postcoder-into-alexa)

Allies provides global address lookup and data validation to over 9,000 businesses around the world through their Postcoder API. My objective was to build and demonstrate a proof of concept that connects the Postcoder address lookup functionality into Amazon Alexa.

I used Python within the web-based Alexa developer console to write the code to process spoken user input such as a postcode, make an address lookup request to Postcoder, parse the JSON that it returns, and then to provide a spoken response to the user.
