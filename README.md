## Work experience so far

### [Robotica, Norwich](https://robotica.media)

**Junior Software Developer, Summer Placement, June-July 2023**

Robotica is a tech startup developing a fully automated solution for translating speech from 20 languages into signed languages using a realistic human avatar. For summer 2023, I was invited back to undertake an R&D project to investigate whether deepfake technology could make their avatars more realistic.

- Identified and evaluated multiple deep learning projects and selected the best performing tool
- Built a local proof of concept
- Converted that to a containerised Docker image with additional logic in the Dockerfile
- Provisioned resources on OVHcloud to run containers more quickly
- Included object storage, high performance instances and an image registry
- Managed these resources using AWS CLI (compatible with OVHcloud)
- Held a conference call with OVHcloud and established a strong supplier relationship with them
- Supported the company at an event (Norfolk Deaf Festival) and addressed enquiries at their stall


### [Robotica, Norwich](https://robotica.media)

**Junior Software Developer, Summer Placement, August 2022**

Robotica is a tech startup developing a fully automated solution for translating speech from 20 languages into signed languages using a realistic human avatar. I applied for a summer placement after completing my A-Levels and was asked to support an existing project by automating the extraction of MP3 audio and transcript data from open source ebook collection, Project Gutenberg.

- Developed Python code to scan the Project Gutenberg website and retrieve data
- Explored and downloaded MP3 audio files and transcript files for each book programmatically
- Used SQLite to store, query and manipulate the collected data
- Wrote code to convert the MP3 audio files to WAV format for compatibility purposes
- Output the files into individual folders for easy management and access during subsequent steps


### [Allies Computing, Norwich](https://www.alliescomputing.com)

**Junior Software Developer, Summer Placement, August 2021**

Allies provides postal address lookup technology to over 9,000 businesses around the world through their API called Postcoder. I applied for a summer placement and was invited to build a proof of concept for integrating Postcoder into Amazon Alexa. Here’s the press release they wrote about it: 

> News article: [Allies work experience student plugs Postcoder into Alexa](https://alliescomputing.com/news/student-plugs-postcoder-into-alexa)

- Developed the proof of concept using Python within the web-based Alexa developer console
- Implemented code to process spoken user input, specifically postcode information
- Called Postcoder to make address lookups based on spoken user input
- Parsed JSON response received from Postcoder API to extract relevant address information
- Generated a spoken response using the extracted address details
- Demonstrated the PoC to the Allies team; it also gained the interest of Royal Mail too
